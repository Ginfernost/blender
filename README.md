## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on creating a 3D design from a 2D map using Blender, leveraging the Blender-OSM and Mitsuba-Blender plugins. Blender-OSM allows you to import OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into Blender, while the Mitsuba-Blender plugin enables the rendering of these scenes using the Mitsuba renderer.

## Goals
- To enable users to transform 2D map data into 3D models in Blender.
- To guide users in installing and utilizing the Blender-OSM and Mitsuba-Blender plugins.

## Prerequisites
- A computer with internet access.
- Basic knowledge of Blender’s interface and functionalities.

## Downloading and Installing Blender
1. **Download Blender**:
   - Go to the official Blender website: [https://www.blender.org/download/](https://www.blender.org/download/).
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Click the `Download` button and save the installer to your computer.

2. **Install Blender**:
   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
   - Once installed, launch Blender by double-clicking the Blender icon on your desktop or from the Start menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).

## Installing Blender-OSM
1. **Purchase and Download Blender-OSM**:
   - Visit the [Blender-OSM Product Page](https://prochitecture.gumroad.com/l/blender-osm) to purchase and download the plugin.
   - Save the downloaded zip file to your computer.

2. **Install Blender-OSM in Blender**:
   - Open Blender and go to the `Edit` menu at the top, then select `Preferences`.
   - In the Preferences window, click on the `Add-ons` tab on the left.
   - Click the `Install` button at the top right and navigate to the downloaded Blender-OSM zip file.
   - Select the file and click `Install Add-on`.
   - Enable the add-on by checking the box next to it in the list.

## Installing Mitsuba-Blender
1. **Download Mitsuba-Blender**:
   - Go to the [Mitsuba-Blender GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba-blender) and download the latest version as a zip file.
   - Save the zip file to your computer.

2. **Install Mitsuba-Blender in Blender**:
   - Follow the same steps as for installing Blender-OSM:
     - Go to `Edit` > `Preferences` in Blender.
     - Click on the `Add-ons` tab and then the `Install` button.
     - Navigate to the downloaded Mitsuba-Blender zip file, select it, and click `Install Add-on`.
     - Enable the add-on by checking the box next to it.

## Importing 2D Map Data with Blender-OSM
1. **Open Blender**:
   - Launch Blender if it’s not already open.

2. **Access Blender-OSM**:
   - In the `3D Viewport`, look to the right sidebar.
   - If the sidebar is not visible, press `N` to open it.
   - Find and click the `OSM` tab to access the plugin.

3. **Select the Area**:
   - Click the `Select` button within the OSM tab.
   - A map window will appear.
   - Navigate and zoom into your desired area on the map.
   - Draw a rectangle around the area by clicking and dragging.

4. **Copy Coordinates**:
   - After selecting the area, the coordinates are usually copied automatically. If not, click the `Copy` button.

5. **Paste Coordinates**:
   - Go back to the OSM import panel in Blender.
   - Paste the copied coordinates into the appropriate fields (latitude and longitude bounds).

6. **Import Data**:
   - Click the `Import` button and wait for the data to load into Blender. This may take some time depending on the size and complexity of the area.
   
7. **Adjust Imported Data**:
   - Use Blender’s modeling tools to adjust buildings, roads, and terrain as needed.

## Rendering the 3D Scene with Mitsuba
1. **Prepare for Export**:
   - Ensure the coordinate system is set to Y Forward and Z Up.
   - Enable export options to include IDs for material properties.

2. **Export Scene**:
   - Use Mitsuba-Blender to export the scene to an XML file and a meshes folder.
   - In Blender, go to `File` > `Export` and select the Mitsuba format.
   - Choose the export location and file name, then click `Export`.

3. **Render Scene**:
   - Load the exported scene into Mitsuba for rendering.
   - Open Mitsuba, navigate to the exported XML file, and load it.
   - Adjust rendering settings as needed and start the render.

## Conclusion
By following this detailed guide, you can transform 2D map data into detailed 3D models and render them using the Mitsuba renderer within Blender. This process is ideal for creating accurate and visually compelling 3D representations of real-world environments.
