## Introduction
This guide provides detailed instructions on transforming 2D image designs into 3D models using Blender. The focus is on creating walls, adding holes for doors using the Boolean modifier, and modeling doors.

## Goals
- To guide users in creating 3D models from 2D image designs in Blender.
- To provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for modeling walls and doors.

## Prerequisites
- A computer with Blender installed.
- Basic knowledge of Blenderâ€™s interface and functionalities.
- A 2D image design to use as a reference.

## Modeling 3D Structures from 2D Images

### Setting Up the Background Image
1. **Import the 2D Image**:
   - Open Blender and switch to the `3D Viewport`.
   - Press `N` to open the sidebar, go to the `View` tab, and scroll down to the `Background Images` section.
   - Click `Add Image` and then `Open` to load your 2D design image.

2. **Position and Scale the Image**:
   - Adjust the position and scale of the image so it fits well within the viewport.
   - Use the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` axis options to move and scale the image appropriately.

### Creating the Base Mesh
1. **Add a Plane**:
   - Press `Shift+A` and select `Mesh > Plane` to add a plane to the scene.
   - Scale the plane to match the dimensions of your 2D image by pressing `S` and moving the mouse. Confirm with a left-click.

### Modeling Walls
1. **Enter Edit Mode**:
   - Select the plane and press `Tab` to enter Edit Mode.

2. **Create Wall Outline**:
   - Use the knife tool (press `K`) to cut the plane along the lines of your 2D design to create an outline of the walls.
   - Click to create points and confirm cuts by pressing `Enter`.

3. **Extrude Walls**:
   - Select the faces that represent the walls.
   - Press `E` to extrude them upwards, creating the height of the walls. Use the mouse to adjust the height and click to confirm.
   - For precision, press `Z` after `
